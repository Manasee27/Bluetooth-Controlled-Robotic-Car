# Bluetooth Controlled Robotic Car(IOT)

In this project we are using Bluetooth wireless technology to control our robot car which is a very simple communication system. The remote in this project is an Android device which has Bluetooth feature built in. 
The user has to install an application on the Android device. The user can perform various actions like moving Forward, Backward, move Left, move Right using commands sent from the Android mobile. We have used a Bluetooth module in our robot car that gets connected to the phoneâ€™s Bluetooth and allows us to communicate.

Here the whole system is divided into four principal blocks:
1.	Bluetooth module
2.	Microcontroller (Arduino)
3.	Motor driver
4.	DC Motor


Following is the circuit diagram-
